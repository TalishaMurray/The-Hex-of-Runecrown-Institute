This is a passion project for myself where I plan to implement a choose your own adventure style game.
So far I have a login and register implementation set up so players will eventually be able to save the game and have multiple save files whithout using local storage
I need to actually implement the save game and load game options
I want there to be character customization as well
there will be an inventory and stats in the game

The Game:
The player will play a character starting their first day of university, but this isn't just any university.
No this is RuneCrown a university specifically intended for the supernatural.
The only way to get into this shcool is to be supernatural and of course, that means crazy things happen frequently.
