This is a passion project for myself where I plan to implement a choose your own adventure style game.
So far I have a login and register implementation set up so players will eventually be able to save the game and have multiple save files whithout using local storage
I need to actually implement the save game and load game options
I want there to be character customization as well
there will be an inventory and stats in the game

The Game:
The player will play a character starting their first day of university, but this isn't just any university.
No this is RuneCrown a university specifically intended for the supernatural.
The only way to get into this shcool is to be supernatural and of course, that means crazy things happen frequently.

TODO:
Settle on the locations in the game and create an array with each location and its attributes
Re-work the story delivery since I decided on adding a time element and locations
  (Could possibly do a radomly triggered events strat or contine with a more linear delivery)
settle on stats and inventory usage.
Finish making the sprites and fleshing out the character creator (find a good color tolerance for the color selector)
Add a save and load feature
Add a front page that isn't just a log-in page
possibly add a 'hub' page in case I decide to make multiple games in the future
implement the story! 
Once I have a good enough chunk of story for a demo I want to host this site publicly for people to try out.
